## 📦 About The Project

The Vital Proxy Tester is a powerful yet simple tool built for anyone who works with proxies. Developed with a modern tech stack (Next.js, Tauri, and Zustand), it provides a fast, beautiful, and intuitive cross-platform experience.

No more slow or clunky testing tools. Get instant feedback with a detailed, real-time analysis for each proxy in your list.

### Key Features

- 🚀 **High-Performance Testing:** Asynchronously tests proxies with a configurable concurrency limit to get results fast.
- 📡 **Multi-Protocol Support:** Automatically detects and tests for HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, and SOCKS5 protocols to correctly validate any type of proxy.
- 🌍 **Geo-IP Data:** For each successful proxy, view Status, Latency (TTFB), IP Address, Country, City, and ISP.
- ✨ **Smart & Interactive UI:**
  - **Auto-Parsing:** Paste your list in almost any common format (`host:port:user:pass`, `user:pass@host:port`, etc.) and the app handles it.
  - **Easy Actions:** Copy proxy strings/IPs, view detailed breakdowns, and manage your results with a single click.
  - **Export results:** After a run finishes, use **Export** next to the toolbar actions to copy or download raw proxy lines (all, working, or failed)—the same format you can paste under **Load Proxies**—or download a **CSV** with status, latency, exit IP, country, and error columns for spreadsheets.
- 🔄 **Automatic Updates:** The app notifies you when a new version is available, so you're always up-to-date.
- 💻 **Cross-Platform:** Works seamlessly on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- **🧠 Pro Mode:** Advanced diagnostics like DNS timing, TCP handshake duration, proxy auth time, and more. For power users and professionals.
